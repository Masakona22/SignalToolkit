        Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only one key (a
        secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic data. The
        entities communicating via symmetric encryption must exchange the key so
        that it can be used in the decryption process. This encryption method
        differs from asymmetric encryption where a pair of keys - one public and
        one private - is used to encrypt and decrypt messages.<br />
        <br />
        By using symmetric encryption algorithms, data is "scrambled" so that it
        can't be understood by anyone who does not possess the secret key to
        decrypt it. Once the intended recipient who possesses the key has the
        message, the algorithm reverses its action so that the message is
        returned to its original readable form. The secret key that the sender
        and recipient both use could be a specific password/code or it can be
        random string of letters or numbers that have been generated by a secure
        random number generator (RNG). For banking-grade encryption, the
        symmetric keys must be created using an RNG that is certified according
        to industry standards, such as FIPS 140-2.

        <strong>There are two types of symmetric encryption algorithms:</strong>
        <li>
          <strong>Block algorithms:</strong> Set lengths of bits are encrypted
          in blocks of electronic data with the use of a specific secret key. As
          the data is being encrypted, the system holds the data in its memory
          as it waits for complete blocks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stream algorithms:</strong> Data is encrypted as it streams
          instead of being retained in the system's memory.
        </li>
        These types will be explored further over next sections.

      <p class="secondary-header">What is Symmetric Encryption Used For?</p>
      <P class="text">
        While symmetric encryption is an older method of encryption, it is
        faster and more efficient than asymmetric encryption, which takes a toll
        on networks due to performance issues with data size and heavy CPU use.
        Due to the better performance and faster speed of symmetric encryption
        (compared to asymmetric), symmetric cryptography is typically used for
        bulk encryption / encrypting large amounts of data, e.g. for database
        encryption. In the case of a database, the secret key might only be
        available to the database itself to encrypt or decrypt.
        Industry-standard symmetric encryption is also less vulnerable to
        advances in quantum computing compared to the current standards for
        asymmetric algorithms.
