                What is Encryption?
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Encryption is a way of scrambling data 
                so that only authorized parties can understand the information. 
                In technical terms, it is the process of converting 
                human-readable plaintext to incomprehensible text, 
                also known as ciphertext. In simpler terms, 
                encryption takes readable data 
                and alters it so that it appears random. Encryption requires the use of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)" class="link"> cryptographic key</a>
                to transform the data back into its original readable form.

                Why is Encryption important?
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Encryption is important because it allows you to securely protect data that you don't want anyone else to have access to. 
                Businesses use it to protect corporate secrets, governments use it to secure classified information, 
                and many individuals use it to protect personal information to guard against things like identity theft.<br>
                <strong>Privacy:</strong> Encryption ensures that no one can read 
                communications or data at rest except the intended recipient or the rightful data owner. 
                This prevents attackers, ad networks, Internet service providers, 
                and in some cases governments from intercepting and reading sensitive data, protecting user Privacy.<br>
                <strong>Security:</strong> Encryption helps prevent data breaches, whether the data is in transit or at rest. 
                If a corporate device is lost or stolen and its hard drive is properly encrypted, the data on that device 
                will still be secure. Similarly, 
                encrypted communications enable the communicating parties to exchange sensitive data without leaking the data. <br>
                <strong>Data integrity:</strong> Encryption also helps prevent malicious behavior such as on-path attacks. When data is transmitted across the Internet, 
                encryption ensures that what the recipient receives has not been viewed or tampered with on the way.<br>
                <strong>Regulations:</strong> For all these reasons, many industry and government regulations require companies that handle user data to keep that data encrypted. 
                Examples of regulatory and compliance standards that require encryption include HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and the GDPR.

                How does Encryption work?
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Encryption works by taking plain text and converting it into cipher text, 
                which is made up of seemingly random characters. 
                Only the intended recipients have the key to convert the text back into readable information. 
                The most common form of encryption is symmetric key encryption, 
                which is when the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the information. 
                Asymmetric key encryption is another common form of encryption. 
                This is when one key is used to encrypt the information and another separate but related key is used to decrypt it.

            <p class="text">
                Although encrypted data appears random, encryption proceeds in a logical, predictable way, 
                allowing a party that receives the encrypted data and possesses the right key to decrypt the data,
                turning it back into plaintext. Truly secure encryption will use keys complex enough that a third party is 
                highly unlikely to decrypt or break the ciphertext by brute force â€” in other words, by guessing the key.
