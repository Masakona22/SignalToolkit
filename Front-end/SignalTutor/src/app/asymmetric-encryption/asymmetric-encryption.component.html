      <p class="text">
        Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, is a
        process that uses a pair of related keys -- one public key and one
        private key -- to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from
        unauthorized access or use.
        <br /><br />
        A public key is a cryptographic key that can be used by any person to
        encrypt a message so that it can only be decrypted by the intended
        recipient with their private key. A private key -- also known as a
        secret key -- is shared only with key's initiator.
        <br /><br />
        When someone wants to send an encrypted message, they can pull the
        intended recipient's public key from a public directory and use it to
        encrypt the message before sending it. The recipient of the message can
        then decrypt the message using their related private key. If the sender
        encrypts the message using their private key, the message can be
        decrypted only using that sender's public key, thus authenticating the
        sender. These encryption and decryption processes happen automatically;
        users do not need to physically lock and unlock the message. Many
        protocols rely on asymmetric cryptography, including the transport layer
        security (TLS) and secure sockets layer (SSL) protocols, which make
        HTTPS possible. The encryption process is also used in software programs
        that need to establish a secure connection over an insecure network,
        such as browsers over the internet, or that need to validate a digital
        signature. Increased data security is the primary benefit of asymmetric
        cryptography. It is the most secure encryption process because users are
        never required to reveal or share their private keys, thus decreasing
        the chances of a cybercriminal discovering a user's private key during
        transmission.

        Asymmetric encryption uses a mathematically related pair of keys for
        encryption and decryption: a public key and a private key. If the public
        key is used for encryption, then the related private key is used for
        decryption. If the private key is used for encryption, then the related
        public key is used for decryption.
        <br /><br />
        The two participants in the asymmetric encryption workflow are the
        sender and the receiver. Each has its own pair of public and private
        keys. First, the sender obtains the receiver's public key. Next, the
        plaintext message is encrypted by the sender using the receiver's public
        key. This creates ciphertext. The ciphertext is sent to the receiver,
        who decrypts it with their private key, returning it to legible
        plaintext. Because of the one-way nature of the encryption function, one
        sender is unable to read the messages of another sender, even though
        each has the public key of the receiver.
